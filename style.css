 * This file contains custom CSS rules for the TDEE Calculator.
 * Most of the styling is handled by Tailwind CSS classes directly in index.html.
 * This file is used for specific overrides or custom components not easily
 * achievable with standard Tailwind classes, such as custom radio button appearances
 * and error message visibility.

/*
  The custom radio button styling ensures a consistent look across browsers
  and provides a clear visual indication when selected, improving user experience.
*/
/* Note: Default radio button styles are embedded in the <style> tag of index.html
   for immediate availability and to keep custom appearance logic close to the HTML structure.
   This CSS file is kept for any future additional custom styles.

/* Example for future use:
.custom-input:focus {
    border-color: #6366f1;
    box-shadow: 0 0 0 3px rgba(99, 102, 241, 0.4);
